### FISH

[FISH] spawn occasionally across the land of the Crucible. They are timed challenges for the player with
two main components: a key to collect, and a cache to place it in. If a player can connect both within the allotted
time window, they will be granted loot for their efforts.

The key is a large crystal prism with emissives and VFX to draw the player in. The cache is a hub for the key, with a
hexagonal channel to place it. The key rotates and slides into place, enabling emissives on the cache. The cache's
base glows and its VFX grow more intense as the cache has been fully activated, ready to reward the player.
