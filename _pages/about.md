            <p class="mx-0 mt-2 mb-6 font-xl" align="left" style="font-weight: 800;">
                I'm a passionate Technical Artist with a focus on 
                asset implementation, tools development, and performance.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-0 mb-2 font-lg" align="left">
                As a Technical Artist at Airship Syndicate, I specialize in optimizing internal processes
                for developers by creating tools in Python, C++, and Unreal Blueprints. I also work on diagnosing
                and resolving performance bottlenecks across projects. One of my favorite aspects of the role is
                bringing artists' and designers' creative visions to life, contributing to the development of
                immersive, interactive worlds. 

                <br><br>

                Prior to joining Airship, I worked as both a programmer and producer at Wonder Works Studio, where
                I collaborated with multiple departments to introduce new features and engineer key gameplay systems.

                <br><br>

                I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from UT Dallas, where I also served as an officer of
                the Student Game Developer Association (SGDA) during my studies. In this role, I organized events
                such as developer talks, game jams, and social nights, helping students connect with the game
                development community and gain valuable industry insights.
                
                <br><br>

                In my personal projects, I enjoy developing complex shaders, particle systems, and creating polished,
                engaging gameplay features. Outside of work, you may find me playing games like The Last of Us,
                Breath of the Wild, and Hyper Light Drifter.
